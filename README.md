How to use feature flags in the Unreal Engine sample code

[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a companion repo for the blog article **How to use feature flags in Unreal Engine**. In the article I dicussed an easy way on how you can use feature flags as part of [scripting the editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/scripting-the-unreal-editor-using-python/) by leaveraging Unreal's Python API.
